<p> T-Craft is a fashion organization that renders the service of training aspiring tailors and fashion designers so they can acquire garment making and fashion designing skills. This training will serve as a form of human investment, thereby increasing productivity and the Nigerian economy as a whole. </p>
            <p>According to the Nigeria Labor force survey, the percentage of
youth not in employment, education or training (NEET) as at the

second quarter of 2023 was 13.8%. The National Bureau of

Statistics has also confirmed that the unemployment rate among the
youth,aged between 18 and 25 ,increased by 0.3% from 6.9% by the
first quarter of 2023. In Nigeria, some youth lack proper working
experience, adequate skill empowerment and opportunities to

kickstart their careers as entrepreneurs.

For the purpose of achieving some of the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs); Affordable and Clean Energy (Goal 7), Decent Work and Economic Growth (Goal 8), Reduced Inequalities (Goal 10) and Climate Action (Goal 13), it is therefore imperative that more young people receive

skill-based training.</p>

<p>In order to address this disparity, we intend to provide value by
delivering training services exclusively tailored for youth seeking

practical work experience, secondary school graduates not

attending university yet, and students who are fashion

enthusiasts. </p>
